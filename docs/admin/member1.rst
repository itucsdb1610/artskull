=================================

User Operations
---------------
If you are an admin user with highest privilege level you can operate on users’ databases. You can access user operations from admin panel, first three sub-menus will direct you to previously set pages.

You can list all users and access their profiles


You can also directly access edit page for that user or directly delete each user from this list. If you click the user’s name you can access that user’s profile page. Profile page will show edit buttons on the page if you are an admin with highest privilege.

All admins with highest privilege level can edit all users’ information that are registered to the system including admins. Admins cannot add admin directly, each real person should sign up to the system to show up on users list.

Admin Operations
----------------
Admins with highest privilege level can set other admins’ privilege levels and set other normal users as admin to the system. You can add admin from add admin panel by selecting username from registered users’ from first dropdown list and also you should select the privilege level from the second dropdown list. After you’ve clicked the green “Add” button, user will be set as an admin with selected privilege level and you should be redirected to the same page again.

Admins with highest privilege level also can see all users set as admin to the system with their privilege levels. If you are a user in that category, you can edit that admin’s privilege level and also remove admin rights from that user. Removing admin right from that user will not remove user from the system.
